# Hidden Berkeley: HW2 starter

Create your own public website from this starter, then use a Jupyter notebook to edit the data it displays.

**Start here:** on the [HW2 template repository](https://github.com/macss-berkeley/hw2-hidden-berkeley-template), choose **Use this template → Create a new repository**. Name your copy `hidden-berkeley` and make it public. Clone your copy with GitHub Desktop and open its folder in VS Code. Follow [hw2_hidden_berkeley.ipynb](hw2_hidden_berkeley.ipynb).

## What is in this repository?

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `hw2_hidden_berkeley.ipynb` | Your instructions, data edits, and submission evidence. |
| `docs/_data/locations.csv` | The resource data. The notebook edits this file; the website reads it. |
| `docs/index.md` | The page heading, introduction, and supplied loop that displays the CSV rows. |
| `docs/_config.yml` and `docs/_layouts/default.html` | Supplied website settings and layout. |

GitHub Pages builds the website from `main` and `/docs`. After you push a changed CSV, GitHub rebuilds the page using the new data. Jupyter only edits and saves the data; it does not build the website. The `_data` folder name is required by the website builder.

## Purpose and sources

This guide is for people who are new to Berkeley and want to find useful campus resources. I added the Student Learning Center as a new resource using information from its official website: https://slc.berkeley.edu/.

## Website checks

I checked the Morrison Library page on the published website and compared it with the information in the CSV. I also checked the official UC Berkeley Library webpage to verify the access information. After updating the CSV and pushing the changes, I confirmed that the website displayed the updated resource information correctly.
